1) 3D Reconstruction from Multiple Images :-
--------------------------------------------
   We have followed the book 3D Reconstruction from Multiple
   Images : Part 1 - Principles  by  Theo Moons, Luc Van Gool and    
   Maarten Vergauwen for making a 3D model form Multiple
   Images. 

2) AR for the Web WebXR :-
--------------------------------
    We follow WebXR official documentation and some WebXR
    Sample projects for the reference. WebXR is a group of
    standards which are used together to support rendering 3D
    scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds
    (virtual reality, or VR), or for adding graphical imagery to the
    real world, (augmented reality, or AR). The WebXR Device
    API implements the core of the WebXR feature set, managing
    the selection of output devices, render the 3D scene to  the
    chosen device at the appropriate frame rate, and manage motion
    vectors created using input controllers. 
3) Meshroom :-
----------------
    Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software
    based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision      
    framework . â€ƒ

 
Architecture of Solution :-
---------------------------
The website first fetches the 3D models and their respective images from a directory. When a user clicks on a product, we pass the name of the product as query parameter to the AR part.

Technologies Used :-
----------------------
  CSS, HTML, JavaScript, WebXR , Three.js , Git, GitHub , VSCode.
